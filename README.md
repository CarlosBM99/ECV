Entorns de Comunicaci√≥ Virtual

In this chat application you can log in as a user and select in which room would you like to enter (if it doesn't exist it will be created).

Once you are inside you will see 3 columns. The first one shows your choseen username and the avaliable rooms (if a room is empty it will be deleted). If you click in any of them you will be removed from your current room and enter to the selected one. The number after the room's name tells how many people are inside. If you change your room you will see al the previous messages of that room.

That leads us to the second column. This is the chat. You got the name of the room and the amount of people inside, in the top. You got the textbox in the bottom and the send button. If you type a message and press enter (or the send button) it will be displayed on the left. Other people messages apears on the right. You can see also who is sending every message. You will also be notified if someone leaves or enter in the room. Very intuitive.

The third column is the online canvas. You can draw together with everybody in your room. You can select different colors and an eraser.

The webpage is responsive.
